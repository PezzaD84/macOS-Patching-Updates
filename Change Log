# - API Credentials updated
    The use of encrypted bearer tokens has been added to the update script.

Update:
# - A 4 day deferment has been added to the update script now. 
    Users now have the ability to defer/postpone updates for 4 days and then the updates will be forced to install. You can switch this off by hashing out or removing line 103

# - API Update Command removed
    The use of the Jamf API Update command has been removed due to being very hit and miss and lacking control.
    
# - Updates run from SoftwareUpdate Command
    Updates are now run locally from the SoftwareUpdate command on both M1 and Intel macs.
    
# - Admin elevation
    Users of M1 devices are elevated to Admin to run updates (if they are not) and then demoted to standard once updates are installed.
